# Simple Distributed Ledger

A basic distributed ledger implementation. Although inspired by some blockchain concepts, 
the intended use case is for syncing data between a relatively small number of trusted nodes. This allows 
Simple Distributed Ledger to offload some of the more complex operations typically handled by blockchain 
(e.g. Proof of *X*).
